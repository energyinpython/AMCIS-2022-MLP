# ISD-2022-MLP

This project includes a framework with an application of the Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor for Ranking Prediction in Information Systems for 
Multi-Criteria Sustainability Assessment. 

This Python project includes the application of the 
`MLPRegressor` model from `scikit-learn` for prediction of alternatives' preference values based on historical datasets collected
for an analogous problem with analogous criteria assessed by decision-makers with MCDA methods, using expert criteria weights in the past.
